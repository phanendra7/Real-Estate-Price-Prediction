## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered housing data from trusted sources like Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Model Development:** Implemented models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Linear Regression achieved the highest RÂ² score of 0.76.
4. **Application Development:** Developed a responsive Flutter app to collect user input and display predictions.
5. **Integration:** Deployed the ML model on Flask and integrated it with the mobile app.
